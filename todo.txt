low prio:
use `clf` in the matlab plot of lennard jones sim after each frame
ensure rust ver of lennard jones sim calculation (and non rust ver) has simulationManager class with simulate func and so on
simulationParams class should have subcomponents, PhysicalConstants, SimulationConstants (timestep and stuff), and InitialState
  and you pass the params to initalize method on simulator
  maybe it even has a simulateandsavetofile method that accepts an Option lambda for status printing
